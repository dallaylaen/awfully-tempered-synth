NAME 

Awfully tempered synth - Synthesizer that plays music in N-equal temperation.

USAGE

make
bin/player.pl <your_score.txt>

NOTE: This is in pre-alfa stage now, dragons be here.

WHAT IS THIS FOR 

Ideally, the following conditions should be met:

* It is possible to write down a melody in simple ascii-only text format.
* It is possible to play such a melody via hardware or software synthesizer.
* It is possible to port melodies to different temperations.
* There is a mechanism for keeping melody fragments for later use.
* Replaying of fragments allows for changing key, variations, tempo change etc.
* It is possible to express details at finer level than just notes.

SCORE FORMAT

NOTE: Format is subject to change! 

At least,

* all data is in ASCII
* " "  leading whitespace is ignored
* "#"  lines starting with pound are ignored (comments)
* lines MAY start with a keyword, those are only used for control
* lines MAY start with time adjust spec (tact, subtact division)
* lines MAY contain chords
* a chord MAY contains list of notes and some optional parameters

Currently:

* No header or footer is required;
* The only known keyword is "set". Its usage is like follows:

    set tone 440 tuning 12 tempo 60 meter 4

    ** Tempo is number of tacts in 60 seconds.
    ** Meter is number of parts within a tact.
    ** Tone is A note pitch in Hertz.
    ** Tuning is number of steps in the tuning system.

* "--" (double dash) means moving 1 tack forward in time
* "<nnn>:" (number, colon) means moving by nnn/meter tacts. 
    Fractions are accepted, too.
* A chord is written as 

    chord <N>,<N>,<N> [ vol n len n oct n ]

Here
    ** vol is volume adjustment in dB
    ** len is length in tact/meter
    ** oct shifts all notes by <n> octaves
    ** N is note in one of the forms:
        *** <n> - number of steps from root note in chord
        *** [A-F][b#]? - usual note with alteration sign, resets root to itself
        *** [dmPMA]<n> - diminished/minor/perfect/major/augmented <n>th
            from root note
        *** <n>/<m> - natural interval n/m approximated by current tuning
        Additionally,
        *** Leading = - count interval from from A and become root note
            This holds by default for the first note
        *** Leading + - count from last note, not root note
        *** Leading -?<n>: - move n octaves up/down

For instance,

    chord 0,4,7 len 4

Would play a whole A major chord with values given above.

See examples.
